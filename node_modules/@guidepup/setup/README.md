## Getting Started 🦮

Run this command:

```bash
npx @guidepup/setup
```

And get cracking with your screen-reader automation code! 🚀

## Usage 🐕‍🦺

For some operating systems, enabling control of screen-readers is tightly controlled.

Depending on the security controls in place, setup might require either UI automation, or manual interaction to complete. Checkout [these guides](https://github.com/guidepup/guidepup/tree/main/guides) if your system requires manual configuration.

If you are running this command in CI/CD, it is recommended to add the `--ci` flag to prevent interactive prompts:

```bash
npx @guidepup/setup --ci
```

If you are using GitHub Actions, check out the dedicated [`guidepup/setup-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/guidepup-setup):

```yaml
- name: Setup Environment
  uses: guidepup/setup-action@0.6.3
```

## Recording

If you are encountering errors in CI for MacOS you can pass a `--record` flag to the command which will output a screen-recording of the setup to a `./recordings/` directory.

## NVDA Installation

When running on windows a portable NVDA instance compatible with Guidepup will be installed to a temporary directory. The location of this installation directory is stored in the Windows registry under the key `HKCU\Software\Guidepup\Nvda`.
